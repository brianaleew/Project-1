# H2 Overview:

**Undertale** is a hit RPG (role playing game) that follows the main character as they traverse through the underground and encounter various monsters that engage the character in fights. There's just one catch... _you don't have to fight_.
Every fight is filled with humor and unexpected options as the character attempts to protect their soul (a small heart icon) from incoming projectiles. **This game is inspired by Undertale.** Enjoy!
